  <p>
    Team Fortress 2 is a really cool game. It's a shooter game developed by Valve, the same company that made Steam!.<br>
    The game has two teams that fight against each other, RED and BLU. There are nine different character to choose from.<br>
    The nine classes are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy.<br>
    This game is very fun and wacky. The slapstick humor and goofiness is what makes this game truly timeless.

  <p>
    Persona 4 Golden is my favorite game of the Persona series. It's very cool and has an engaging story.<br>
    I once played this game for 8 hours a day straight for two weeks. That's when I finished it.<br>
    It's a JRPG developed by Atlus. It takes place in a small town known as Inaba. Your character is a high schooler<br>
    moving to a new town for a year. Weird things start happening in the town of Inaba, and the main character and his friends<br>
    get caught up in it. It's a very cool games that you should play.
