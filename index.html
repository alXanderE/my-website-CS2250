		My favorite band of all time is <i>Gojira</i>. They're a metal band from France.
		<ul>
			<li>They started in 1996</li>
			<li>Their band name was Godzilla originally.</li>
			<li>In 2001, they changed their name to Gojira due to copyright reasons</li>
			<li>They released their first album in 2001, which was called <i>Terra Incognita</i>.</li>
			<li>It was their third and fourth albums, <i>From Mars to Sirius</i> (2003) and <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> (2008) respectively, that brought them into the spotlight.</li>
			<li>They were signed onto a major record label called Roadrunner Records in 2011, which allowed their albums to gain more visibility.</li>
			<li>They were nominated for a Grammy in 2016 with their song <i>Silvera</i>.</li>
			<li>They performed at the Olympics in 2024, making them the first metal band to ever perform at the Olympics.</li>
			<li>They also won a Grammy for their performance at the Olympics</li>
		</ul>
